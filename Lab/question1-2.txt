Question 1:
    a. A for loop is acount-controlled loop, and awhile loop
    is a condition-controlled loop. Explain the differences
        - A count controlled loop terminated by default at the end of the count.
        - A condition controlled will terminate once the condition is met

    b. What is wrong with the following code's syntax?
        for a_num in [5,10,1]
            print (a_num)

        - it should be:
        for a_num in range(5,10,1):
            print (a_num)

    c. What happened when a break command is executed in a while loop?
        - the loop is terminated

Question 2:
    a. You must define a function before you can use it in your script.
       True or False? Explain
        - True, you want the def of the funtion first then you can call it since
        pyhton reads from to to bottom and needs to store the funtion in memory.

    b. How do you define a default value for a function parameter.
        You can set default values inside the function definition like so:

        def example(v1 = 10, v2 = 20):
            # do stuff

    c. How do you define a variable number of parameters in a function
       definition?
        - you use the *args argument as a parameter like so:

        def example(*args):
            # do stuff

    d. Local variables can only be referenced from inside the function where
       they are created. True or False? Explain.
        True. If you want to use the variable outside of said function, you need
        to declare them as a Global variable.
